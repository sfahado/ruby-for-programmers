# Ruby 
#  Cross platform
#  Object oriented

# Ruby is an interpreted language so you can run it without first compiling it.

# When a user interacts with a Raila's driven site, say, by writing a blog post or entering some data

# into a wiki, then tools behind the scene process and embedded Ruby.

# And from it they generate new HTML pages to be displayed in the browser.

# Now, there are other ways that frameworks such as rails can be used, but I'm trying to give you a

# typical example of the sort of ways that people create ruby powered websites.

# Now, at the front end is the user interface of the application.

# That's the actual Web pages.

# And that's called The View.

# The back end is the database and any operations required to retrieve or post new data items.

# And that's called the model.

# And between the two is the programming logic that cements the view and the model together.

# And that's where most of the Ruby code lives.

# And that's called the controller.

# Now, put them all together and you've got an MVC model view controller framework.
