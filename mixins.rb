# Ruby allows you to explicitly make some methods public and others private. Public methods allow for an interface with the rest of the program; they say, “Hey! Ask me if you need to know something about my class or its instances.”
# Private methods, on the other hand, are for your classes to do their own work undisturbed. They don’t want anyone asking them anything, so they make themselves unreachable!
class Person
  def initialize(name, age)
    @name = name
    @age = age
  end
  
  public    # This method can be called from outside the class.
  
  def about_me
    puts "I'm #{@name} and I'm #{@age} years old!"
  end
  
  private   # This method can't!
  
  def bank_account_number
    @account_number = 12345

# What's a Module?
# You can think of a module as a toolbox that contains a set methods and constants. There are lots and lots of Ruby tools you might want to use, but it would clutter the interpreter to keep them around all the time. For that reason, we keep a bunch of them in modules and only pull in those module toolboxes when we need the constants and methods inside!

# You can think of modules as being very much like classes, only modules can’t create instances and can’t have subclasses. They’re just used to store things!


module Circle

  PI = 3.141592653589793
  
  def Circle.area(radius)
    PI * radius**2
  end
  
  def Circle.circumference(radius)
    2 * PI * radius
  end
end



# Resolve to Keep Learning
# One of the main purposes of modules is to separate methods and constants into named spaces. This is called (conveniently enough) namespacing, and it’s how Ruby doesn’t confuse Math::PI and Circle::PI.

# See that double colon we just used? That’s called the scope resolution operator, which is a fancy way of saying it tells Ruby where you’re looking for a specific bit of code. If we say Math::PI, Ruby knows to look inside the Math module to get that PI, not any other PI (such as the one we created in Circle).

# Let’s get some practice in with an existing Ruby module: Math.


class Angle
  include Math
  attr_accessor :radians
  
  def initialize(radians)
    @radians = radians
  end
  
  def cosine
    cos(@radians)
  end
end

acute = Angle.new(1)
acute.cosine



module Action
  def jump
    @distance = rand(4) + 2
    puts "I jumped forward #{@distance} feet!"
  end
end

class Rabbit
  include Action
  attr_reader :name
  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end
end

class Cricket
  include Action
  attr_reader :name
  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end
end

peter = Rabbit.new("Peter")
jiminy = Cricket.new("Jiminy")

peter.jump
jiminy.jump



# Extend Your Knowledge
# Whereas include mixes a module’s methods in at the instance level (allowing instances of a particular class to use the methods), the extend keyword mixes a module’s methods at the class level. This means that class itself can use the methods, as opposed to instances of the class.



lass Account
  attr_reader :name, :balance
  def initialize(name, balance=100)
    @name = name
    @balance = balance
  end
  
  def display_balance(pin_number)
    puts pin_number == pin ? "Balance: $#{@balance}." : pin_error
  end
  
  def withdraw(pin_number, amount)
    if pin_number == pin
      @balance -= amount
      puts "Withdrew #{amount}. New balance: $#{@balance}."
    else
      puts pin_error
    end
  end
  
  private
  
  def pin
    @pin = 1234
  end
  
  def pin_error
    "Access denied: incorrect PIN."
  end
end

my_account = Account.new("Eric", 1_000_000)
my_account.withdraw(11, 500_000)

# Excellent work! You’ve got your very own Account class and checking_account instance, complete with public and private methods.

# Go ahead and try to get to your pin from outside the class. Not easy, is it?

# How could you improve this class? You might:

# Include a deposit method that lets users add money to their accounts
# Include error checking that prevents users from overdrawing their accounts
# Create CheckingAccounts or SavingsAccounts that inherit from Account
